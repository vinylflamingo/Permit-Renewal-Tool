Hello! Thank for viewing my portfolio project!

The purpose of this project was to save a time issue. 
In my support position, part of my job is manually reviewing data as it enters the database. 
Making sure the data is correct, to prevent issues both tehcnically and with service coming from police force. 

In New Orleans, the false alarm permits renew on a calender year meaning at the end of the year, I would become overloaded with a large set of data to sift through and check. 
Using the large enterprise software, these renewals could take from 5-20 seconds each. This was largely due to the components the UI had to load in order to display the data. 

I decided I did not want to spend my holiday waiting for UI components to load so instead I designed this small application that only pulled the information I needed to be able to validate the permit renewal. 

The ending result decreased my wasted time and reduced the average time from 15 seconds to 2 seconds. I was able to validate information at lightning speed. After showing my manager (and testing on our test database first),
he schduled a meeting with QA and the enterprise Developer. Both approved what I had done and allowed me to use this tool on the production database. 

Enjoy the code!
